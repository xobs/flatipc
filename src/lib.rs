//! Xous supports sending Messages from Clients to Servers. If a message is
//! a `MemoryMessage`, then the Server may respond by updating the buffer
//! with a response message and returning the buffer.
//!
//! A number of serialization options are available, ranging from sending
//! raw arrays of bytes all the way to sending full Protobuf messages.
//!
//! This crate takes a middle road and allows for sending rich Rust types
//! such as full enums and structs without doing extensive checks. This is
//! based on the theory that in normal operating systems, ABIs do not contain
//! any sort of verification, and it is undefined behaviour to send a malformed
//! request to a loaded module.
//!
//! An object can be made into an IPC object by implementing the `Ipc` trait.
//! The primary method of doing this is by adding `#[derive(flatipc::Ipc)]`
//! to the definition. Such an object may be included in both the Client and
//! the Server so that they share the same view of the object.
//!
//! Any object may be made into an IPC object provided it follows the following
//! requirements:
//!
//! - **The object is `#[repr(C)]`** - This is required to ensure the objecty
//!   has a well-defined layout in memory. Other representations may shift
//!   depending on optimizations.
//! - **The object only contains fields that are `IpcSafe`** - This trait is
//!   implemented on primitive types that are able to be sent across an IPC
//!   boundary. This includes all integers, floats, and booleans. It also
//!   includes arrays of `IpcSafe` types, `Option<T>` where `T` is `IpcSafe`,
//!   and `Result<T, E>` where `T` and `E` are `IpcSafe`. Pointers and
//!   references are not `IpcSafe` and may not be used.
//!
//! When deriving `Ipc`, a new type will be created with the same name as
//! the original type prefixed with `Ipc`. For example, if you derive `Ipc`
//! on a type named `Foo`, the new type will be named `IpcFoo`.
//!
//! Objects that implement `Ipc` must be page-aligned and must be a full multiple
//! of a page size in length. This is to ensure that the object can be mapped
//! transparently between the Client and the Server without dragging any extra
//! memory along with it.
//!
//! `Ipc` objects implement `Deref` and `DerefMut` to the original object, so
//! they can be used in place of the original object in most cases by derefencing
//! the `Ipc` object.
//!
//! Because `String` and `Vec` contain pointers, they are not `IpcSafe`. As such,
//! replacements are made available in this crate that are `IpcSafe`.
//!
//! <br>
//!
//! # Example of a Derived Ipc Object
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C)]
//! #[derive(flatipc::Ipc)]
//! pub struct Foo {
//!   a: u32,
//!   b: u64,
//! }
//!
//! // Connect to an example server
//! let conn = xous::connect(xous::SID::from_bytes(b"example---server").unwrap())?;
//!
//! // Construct our object
//! let foo = Foo { a: 1, b: 1234567890 };
//!
//! // Create an IPC representation of the original object, consuming
//! // the original object in the process.
//! let mut foo_ipc = foo.into_ipc();
//!
//! // Lend the object to the server with opcode 42.
//! foo_ipc.lend(conn, 42)?;
//!
//! // Note that we can still access the original object.
//! println!("a: {}", foo_ipc.a);
//!
//! // When we're done with the IPC object, we can get the original object back.
//! let foo = foo_ipc.into_original();
//! ```
//!
//! # Example of Server Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // Ideally this comes from a common `API` file that both the
//! // client and server share.
//! #[repr(C)]
//! #[derive(flatipc::Ipc)]
//! pub struct Foo {
//!   a: u32,
//!   b: u64,
//! }
//!
//! let mut msg_opt = None;
//! let mut server = xous::create_server_with_sid(b"example---server").unwrap();
//! loop {
//!     let envelope = xous::receive_message(server, &mut msg_opt).unwrap();
//!     let Some(msg) = msg_opt else { continue };
//!
//!     // Take the memory portion of the message, continuing if it's not a memory message.
//!     let Some(msg_memory) = msg.memory_message() else { continue };
//!
//!     // We must use `unsafe` here to gain access to the memory as a `u8` slice.
//!     let msg_slice = unsafe { msg_memory.buf().as_slice() };
//!
//!     // The signature is stored in the `offset` field.
//!     let signature = msg_memory.offset.map(|offset| offset.get()).unwrap_or_default();
//!
//!     // Note that we need to use the `IpcFoo` variant to access the object.
//!     // If the object is not the correct type, `None` will be returned and
//!     // the message will be returned.
//!     let Some(foo) = IpcFoo::from_slice_mut(msg_slice, signature) else { continue };
//!
//!     // Do something with the object.
//! }
//! ```
